# GoTournament

Create any type of tournament with go. This is a hobby project and I am open to others contributing, feel free to open a pull request or make an issue.

Currently I support group tournaments but I want to make my functions more generic with interfaces and also support other tournament forms such as elimination, double elimination, round robin and more.
